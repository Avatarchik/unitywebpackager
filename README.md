# Unity Web Packager
## Introduction
**Unity Web Packager** is a tool made with Python that encapsulates and packages a WebGL game generated with Unity3D into a binary executable,
 so it can be installed and treated like a native game.

The binary generated by this tool can be executed in Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux and ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi.

## Requisites
In order to run and use this tool you will need to have installed in your computer the following items:
* *Python 3* that you can grab from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* *Qt 5* that you can grab from [here](https://www.qt.io/download/).
* *PyQt 5* that you can grab from [here](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5).

## Usage
To use this tool, just invocate it using Terminal. It is mandatory to pass a value for the following arguments along with
the `package` flag:

* `--build-dir`: the directory where the game was exported to WebGL using Unity3D
* `--output-dir`: the directory where the binary executable source code is going to be stored
* `--development`: configure Unity Web Packager to convert a development or release Unity 3D WebGL build.

For example, issuing the following command tells to the tool that the WebGL build files are in the `/Example/WebGL`
 directory,  the binary source code will be generated in the `/Example/build` path and the build exported from Unity3D is
 a release:

`unitywebpackager.py  package --build-dir /Example/WebGL  --output-dir /Example/build --development false
`

Notice that **Unity Web Packager** only generates the source code of the final binary executable. The developer must compile the
source code in the deployment machine. For example, if he wants to package a game that must be compatible with the Raspberry
Pi, he must compile the source code in a Raspberry Pi.

You can get more help of this tool issuing the command `unitywebpackager.py --help`.
